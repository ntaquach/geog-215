## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ex5, message=F, warning=F}
getwd()
setwd("C:/GitHub Projects/geog-215")
iris <- read.csv("./Data/iris.csv")

#mean petal length
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_petal=mean(Petal.Length))


al_hosp <- read.csv("./Data/AL_hospitals.csv")
str(al_hosp)

mean_nop <- al_hosp %>% group_by(City) %>%
  summarise(mean_nop=mean(Number.of.Patients, na.rm=T))
mean_nop
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
